# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## milestone_2

I have created a list of 5 fruits to be used for the game.

The program will pick a random fruit from the list.

The user will guess a letter and the program will confirm that the input is valid.
