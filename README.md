# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## milestone_2

I have created a list of 5 fruits to be used for the game.

The program will pick a random fruit from the list.

The user will guess a letter and the program will confirm that the input is valid.

## milestone_3

I have created a function to check if the letter guessed is in the random word chosen from the list.

I have created a function which allows the user guess a letter and confirm a valid input.

## milestone_4

I have created the hangman class.

I defined attributes for the word list, number of lives, random word chosen, guessed word, number of letters and a list of guessed letters.

I have created a method to check if the letter guessed is in the random word chosen from the list.

I have created a method which allows the user guess a letter, confirm if it is a valid input and check if it has already been used.

## milestone_5

I bring all the code together.

I created a function which allows the game be played till the user either guesses the correct word or runs out of guesses.

When the function play_game is called, with a list of words as an attribute, the hangman game begins.

A random word will be chosen from the word_list and the user will need to guess the letters of the word correctly to win within the given number of lives (5 lives)

The user will be asked for input, the methods in the hangman class will check for the validity of the input and if the guessed letter is correct.

It will continue to ask for input till the user runs out of lives or guesses all the letters of the hidden word.![hangman_milestone_5_pic_3](https://github.com/Trone77/hangman/assets/121750173/c58f134d-eb22-4e44-a971-8f0ff8c108b0)
